# Problem Statement

## Overview

In today's rapidly evolving technological landscape, organizations face complex challenges that require intelligent decision-making systems capable of autonomous problem-solving. Traditional rule-based systems lack the adaptability and learning capabilities needed to handle dynamic, real-world scenarios effectively.

## Problem Description

The primary challenges include:

1. **Limited Autonomy**: Existing systems require constant human intervention for decision-making, leading to inefficiencies and delays.

2. **Inability to Learn**: Traditional algorithms cannot adapt to changing environments or learn from past experiences, making them unsuitable for complex, dynamic problems.

3. **Poor Scalability**: Current solutions struggle to handle large-scale data processing and complex search spaces efficiently.

4. **Lack of Intelligent Planning**: Many systems cannot perform sophisticated path planning or optimization tasks that require heuristic reasoning.

5. **Insufficient Decision Support**: Organizations lack comprehensive tools that combine machine learning with intelligent agent frameworks for robust decision-making.

## Motivation

This project addresses these challenges by developing an intelligent agent system that:

- Implements rational agents capable of perceiving environments and taking autonomous actions
- Integrates machine learning algorithms for learning from data patterns
